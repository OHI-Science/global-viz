Visualizations for OHI Global Assessments

The idea of this repository is to host all creative initiatives for visualizing OHI materials. It was created in 2018 under the Global Fellowship Program.

Folders in this repository:
- region_cards --> contains code and figures that specifically feed into the regional summary cards.
- region_maps --> creates two maps for each region highlighting its eez (one world map and a zoom in map)
- rgn_plots --> code for ploting scores over time for each region and the ranking plot for each region.
